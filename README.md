DOMTokenList-Polyfill
=====================

Exactly as the repo's name implies. Adds support for HTML5's DOMTokenList API for Internet Explorer versions 8-9.

Naturally, this script does absolutely nothing if the browser already supports DOMTokenList (which is virtually every modern browser, it's just versions of Explorer between 8-9 that can't hack it).

Tested with IE8 & IE9, obviously.
